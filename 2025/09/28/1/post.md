In [/links/2025-07-26-optimizing-life/](/links/2025-07-26-optimizing-life/) I mentioned that I had stopped wearing my Apple Watch.

When I shared that link, the AW had already been off my wrist for quite a while. But over the past few weeks, I’ve started wearing it again. Mostly because my Whoop subscription ends next year, and I’m testing whether the AW can fully replace it. We’ll see how that goes.
