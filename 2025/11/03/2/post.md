## Every Play Counts – What Customer Success Can Learn from Football  

Every now and then, I stumble upon something that seems unrelated to my work, and that’s exactly why it sticks. Some time ago, I came across [an article about Vince Lombardi](https://www.packers.com/news/vince-lombardi-one-play-can-make-or-break-an-nfl-season-19249576), the legendary American football coach. He described how **every single play counts**, because a team only gets so many in a game. Each one can decide between victory and defeat.  

Even though I’ve never played football myself, I found that analogy instantly fitting, especially for **Customer Success**.  

### Every interaction is a play  

Whether it’s a conversation at a conference, a QBR, a support follow-up, or a quick chat in between, **every interaction with a customer is a play**. And just like in football, you never know which one will make the difference.  

Maybe it’s that spontaneous chat at a trade show that builds trust. Maybe it’s the quick response to a seemingly small issue that influences a renewal decision. Or that quiet moment when a customer realizes we’re truly listening.  

### Success is built on many small, deliberate moves  

In Customer Success, there’s rarely that one big moment that changes everything. Real success comes from **many small, consistent interactions** that gradually build a relationship over time. Just like in football, it’s not the spectacular that wins, it’s the disciplined, the repeated, the intentional.  

That’s why we should **treat every encounter with care**, especially the fleeting ones, like those at events or conferences. Instead of seeing conversations merely as “leads” or “touchpoints,” we can view them as **opportunities to build trust**.  

Because sometimes, it’s that one play that determines whether a customer stays, or walks away.
