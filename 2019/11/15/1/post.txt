As mentioned last week I still attended more sessions at Microsoft Ignite. So following the remaining sessions which I attended and I would recommend to anyone interested in latest Microsoft technology.

* In [A Vault for your CI/CD Pipeline](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/87564) [Joey Lorich](https://github.com/jlorich) explains how Terraform KeyVault can be integrated in your CI/CD pipeline to keep your secrets secret.
* Pretty amazing to see that testing tools will be available for Power Apps in the upcoming weeks. [Optimize your apps with quality tools for Power Apps](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/83519) demonstrates all the upcoming possibilities.
* Very interesting to see how Azure Functions can even be run on-premises using Docker/Kubernetes. [Serverless Kubernetes with Azure Functions and Azure Kubernetes Service](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/83959) demonstrates how even the tooling for scaling up/down is available when running Azure Functions in Kubernetes.

I attended more session but from my point of view these sessions would be only interesting for people who currently want to dive deeper into the Power Platform.

Nevertheless here are some more interesting things which I found this week.

It is always good if you can name things when trying to improve them. This is even more important when you are trying to refactor code. [Refactoring - What problem on your code do you want to fix?](https://dev.to/rachc/refactoring-what-problem-on-your-code-do-you-want-to-fix-487f) explains which common patterns can often be found before starting to refactor.

[The one mistake I made as a developer I wished I learned sooner](https://medium.com/@PurpleGreenLemon/the-one-mistake-i-made-as-a-developer-i-wished-i-learned-sooner-140d37214999) goes in detail why it is important to protect your time and how you can achieve this.

I think that the characteristics mentioned in [Seven Common Characteristics of Creative Thinkers](https://dev.to/jamiepo/seven-common-characteristics-of-creative-thinking-3i94) are very useful especially for developers. I think so because from my point of view developing software is kind of a creative skill because often you need to find a solution for something which hasn't been done before.

Having a basic understanding of how a server works is a invaluable thing for a developer at least from my point of view. [The introduction to servers I wish I'd had](https://dev.to/harri_etty/the-introduction-to-servers-i-wish-i-d-had-44jl) is a great introduction how you can get a better understanding of servers.
