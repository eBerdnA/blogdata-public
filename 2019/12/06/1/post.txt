Today everyone in software development should be doing CI/CD or at least know what it is. [Three Common Pitfalls of CI/CD, and How to Avoid Them](https://dev.to/scahhht/three-common-pitfalls-of-ci-cd-and-how-to-avoid-them-2c9l) shows three pitfalls which you should not fall into when doing so.

Maybe someone who is reading about Kubernetes has seen the term »Service Mesh«. [The Service Mesh: What Every Software Engineer Needs to Know about the World's Most Over-Hyped Technology](https://servicemesh.io/) explains what you need to know on this topic.

To know patterns is always useful when working as a developer/software architect. [Options Pattern in .NET Core](https://codeburst.io/options-pattern-in-net-core-a50285aeb18d) shows how you can use the former mentioned pattern to register your dependencies in an ASP.NET Core application.

If you liked what you read about dealing with the options pattern but don't have any experience in .NET [Learn .NET Core](https://dev.to/azure/learn-net-core-1jcn) is just the right article for you.
