Even though I've heard [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) or Site Reliability Engineering many times in the past and had a rough understanding of what it means I never really got into the fundamentals of it.

From my point of view this ([Introduction to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/intro-to-site-reliability-engineering/)) introduction by Microsoft really lays the foundation for a basic understanding of SRE. Therefore I really recommend working through this introduction.
