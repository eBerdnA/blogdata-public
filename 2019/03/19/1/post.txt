 <p>Even though I&rsquo;ve heard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering" target="_blank">SRE</a> or Site Reliability Engineering many times in the past and had a rough understanding of what it means I never really got into the fundamentals of it.</p>
<p>From my point of view this (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/intro-to-site-reliability-engineering/" target="_blank">Introduction to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)</a>) introduction by Microsoft really lays the foundation for a basic understanding of SRE. Therefore I really recommend working through this introduction.</p>
