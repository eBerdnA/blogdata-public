Having done this in the past time for some time I would like to get traction in this again. So I will try to post a weekly collection of links which are interesting from my point of view. Sometimes including a personal comment. Most of the content will be tech related.

So this is the first edition of this for calendar week 35. The upcoming weeks this post will be always published Friday morning. Due to the fact that I only started to gather content for this post in the middle of the week there are only to recommendations for this week.

[The state of software engineering](http://danielbachler.de/2019/08/11/the-state-of-software-engineering.html) - Especially interesting because of the comparison to other professions which do exist quite longer than software engineering.

[Understanding Azure Durable Functions - Part 1: Overview](http://dontcodetired.com/blog/post/Understanding-Azure-Durable-Functions-Part-1-Overview) - Very good introduction to [Durable Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview). Til today the tenth part of this series has been published by [Jason Roberts](https://twitter.com/robertsjason).
