After starting to publish content on this domain I used a custom [static site generator](https://andre.bering.in/posts/2018-10-26-hello-world-statcoreblog/) which I built using .NET core. Then after some time I switched to a custom static generator which I have built using python.

Then after some time I came to the conclusion that building and maintaining my own site generator doesn't provide any real benefit to me. Therefore I decided to switch to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). After preparing my theme and migrating the content this page is now running based on the output of Hugo.

The content is now stored in a Github repository which triggers a webhook after commits. This receiving part for this webhook is running on my server. After receiving a webhook trigger from Github the script runs a git pull for the repository and starts processing with Hugo. After some seconds the new content is then visible on this page.
