 <p><a href="/posts/2019-06-14-azure-architect-map">Recently</a> I posted about a great map which helps choosing the right component from Azure when designing a solution. <a href="https://twitter.com/stephaneeyskens" target="_blank">Stephane Eyskens</a> has published another great map. You can find his post here: <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Developer-Community-Blog/The-Azure-Security-Architect-Map/ba-p/714091" target="_blank">Azure Security Map</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to his other maps <strong>Azure Infrastructure Architect Map</strong> and <strong>Azure Application Architect Map</strong> which he mentioned he will be creating.</p>
