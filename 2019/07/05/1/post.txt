[Recently](/posts/2019-06-14-azure-architect-map) I posted about a great map which helps choosing the right component from Azure when designing a solution. [Stephane Eyskens](https://twitter.com/stephaneeyskens) has published another great map. You can find his post here: [Azure Security Map](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Developer-Community-Blog/The-Azure-Security-Architect-Map/ba-p/714091).

I'm really looking forward to his other maps __Azure Infrastructure Architect Map__ and __Azure Application Architect Map__ which he mentioned he will be creating.
