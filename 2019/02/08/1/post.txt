 <p>For reasons it could be possible that you need to get the information when a service was restarted. First of all you need to find the process id.</p>
<pre><code>ps | grep &quot;uwsgi&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Using the so found process id you can now get the information of the last restart.</p>
<pre><code>ps -p &lt;processId&gt; -o lstart
</code></pre>
