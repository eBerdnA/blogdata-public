Having done some work around PowerApps recently I found the following two links very useful.

&nbsp;&nbsp;[PowerApps Canvas App Coding Standards and Guidelines](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powerapps-canvas-app-coding-standards-and-guidelines/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;[PowerApps and Microsoft Flow Governance and Deployment Whitepaper is now available](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/de-de/blog/powerapps-enterprise-deployment-whitepaper/)

Moreover I watched a webcast which showcases the internal use of PowerApps at Microsoft.

&nbsp;&nbsp;[Walk through creating the internal Microsoft PowerApps Tool “Thrive” application with Pat Dunn](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Video-Gallery/Walk-through-creating-the-internal-Microsoft-PowerApps-Tool/td-p/351332)
