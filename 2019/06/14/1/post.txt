 <p>Being an active reader of the <a href="http://blog.cwa.me.uk/" target="_blank">The Morning Brew</a> today I found something interesting. <a href="https://twitter.com/stephaneeyskens" target="_blank">Stephane Eyskens</a> created an Azure Architect Map which helps you choosing the right Azure service when designing a solution. 
You can find his post here: <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Developer-Community-Blog/The-Azure-Architect-Map/ba-p/689700" target="_blank">The Azure Architect Map - Microsoft Tech Community</a>. Stephane created a mind map which helps you differentiate the Azure services. From my point of view very useful.</p>
