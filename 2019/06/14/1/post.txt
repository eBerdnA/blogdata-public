Being an active reader of the [The Morning Brew](http://blog.cwa.me.uk/) today I found something interesting. [Stephane Eyskens](https://twitter.com/stephaneeyskens) created an Azure Architect Map which helps you choosing the right Azure service when designing a solution. 
You can find his post here: [The Azure Architect Map - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Developer-Community-Blog/The-Azure-Architect-Map/ba-p/689700). Stephane created a mind map which helps you differentiate the Azure services. From my point of view very useful.
