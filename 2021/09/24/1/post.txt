> I experience a lot of random errors on Azure. Code Functions will randomly fail to trigger until redeployed, builds pushed into Oryx will not always successfully complete. There isnâ€™t the feeling of robustness with it that you get elsewhere. 

I also see things described in this post from time to time. Especially random error messages and inconsistent behaviour si something which really can drive you nuts.

Therefore, I agree with the conclusion the Microsoft should spent some time serious engineering on both security and availability.
