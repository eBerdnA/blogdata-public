> It's a perfect episode among many great episodes. The high-concept risk paid off, and it still holds up a decade (!) later as dexterous writing and effortless comedy that allowed each actor to be in their element.

For me Community is definitely one of the best series I've ever watched. Especially the nice combination of empathy displayed combined with a nice (dark) sense of humour made it so special for me. I definitely agree with the author of the article that this episode is the best one of the series.
