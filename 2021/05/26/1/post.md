For as long as the Power Platform has existed, developers have wanted a free way to experiment with it.  
In 2017, the "Power Apps Community Plan" was [introduced](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/de-de/blog/communityplan/). Even though this was free, it unfortunately did not offer all the possibilities that developers would like to play with.

Since this [Microsoft Build](https://register.build.microsoft.com/), we now know that it takes a bit of time for Microsoft to respond to the developers' pleas, but that the wishes are ultimately fulfilled.

And so the [Power Apps Developer Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/developer-plan) [was introduced](https://news.microsoft.com/build-2021-book-of-news/#a-512-new-professional-development-tools-for-power-apps-help-developers-deliver-low-code-solutions-) yesterday.
Compared to the old Community Plan, this offers significantly more functions that can be used.
