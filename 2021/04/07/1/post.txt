I've written about the maps of [Stephane Eyskens](https://twitter.com/stephaneeyskens) [before](/posts/2019-08-06-azure-infrastructure-architect-map/). I must admit that I did not follow up on the following publishing's by him. Today I just noticed that he added another map to his portfolio.

[The Azure Data Architecture Map - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-developer-community-blog/the-azure-data-architecture-map/ba-p/2251943)

It is pretty neat that he simply put a link to all of his maps in his most recent post so that one has all information in one place.
