> As cloud adoption rises, so does cloud "sticker shock." That tremendous savings seen from the switch to up-front CapEx investments in information technology to subscription mode soon gets soured as the rising monthly bills come in for services nobody knows where and when they are being used.

Although many cloud providers advertise that cost savings can be achieved, the reality then looks different in many places. Especially the distinction between (CapEx)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure] and (OpEx)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense] looks tempting at first glance, but in practice it often fails to meet the high expectations.
