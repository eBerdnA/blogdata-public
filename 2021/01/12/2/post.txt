As you might have noticed I haven't published anything since the last [entry](/posts/2020-09-14-back-to-wordpress) where I mentioned that I switched back to WordPress.

Being a technical person I really don't like the experience of putting content into WordPress. Meanwhile I've been trying to get around this by faciliating the `wp cli` which didn't work out very well for me.

Therefore I decided to get back on track to create a custom CMS. This time in Python. For storing content I followed an approach which I was inspired by [Aaron Pericki](https://aaronparecki.com/).

Moreover I looked into [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) and therefore I decided to split content into different types like notes, articles and bookmarks. **Due to this the feed structure of this site will change a little bit. You can find all details for feeds [here](/feeds/).**

If nothing is changed in the Feed Reader, all content will show up in this default feed ([/feed](/feed)) in the future.
