> So to summarize, here are my key points from this talk, in a nutshell — please make these your key takeaways.
> 
> * Distributed teams are better than localized teams — not because they’re distributed, but because they’re asynchronous.
> * Avoid anything that makes a distributed team run synchronously.
> * Use less chat.
> * Have fewer meetings.
> * Write. Things. Down.
