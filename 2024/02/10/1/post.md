> We can reverse the enshittification of the internet. We can halt the creeping enshittification of every digital device. We can build a better, enshittification-resistant digital nervous system, one that is fit to co-ordinate the mass movements we will need to fight fascism, end genocide, save our planet and our species.

I guess many people read or heard about the term enshittification in the last few months. In this article Cory Doctorow explains how companies get to the point of enshittification. The upside is that he also sees a trend which might reverse enshittification.

It's a long article (more like an essay) but it's definitely worth spending your time reading it.
