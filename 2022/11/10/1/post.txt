Making beautiful photos isn't just a question of technique. More important is the composition of the picture. And for this you have to pay attention to your surroundings. That's why it might be a good idea to take at least one picture every day because then somehow you might get more mindful (even though I really dislike this buzzword at the moment).

And I suppose meetings are something that come to mind first for most people. So this is the introduction to a series of 4 articles in total which might provide some food for thought regarding the necessity of meetings.
