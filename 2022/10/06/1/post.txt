This is the first post of hopefully long term series. "WIRLW" stands for "What I've read last week" and will be a loose collection of things I've read in the last week (which you've might have already guessed). This won't be just another collection of links but I will also provide some notes for each link.

- [Elderblog Sutra: 13](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2022/04/28/elderblog-sutra-13/), published 2022-04-28  
This article is little bit older but [Venkatesh Rao](https://twitter.com/vgr) philosophizes about what it would mean to the blogging ecosystem if Elon Musk is buying Twitter (as we now know won't happen). 
- [Thread by @iximiuz](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1563851156417298434.html), published 2022-08-28  
Pretty interesting read, seeing many myths about Containers (not the transport ones) being debunked. Key takeways are:
    - Containers need not have a full Operating System inside them
    - it's possible to run a Container without an image but you propably shouldn't
    - you need containers to build images
    - Containers are not just a linux but instead a standardized execution environments
    - You can create a bootable linux from an image. Even though it's possible you shouldn't do it except for your own entertainment.
- [Seeking the Productive Life: Some Details of My Personal Infrastructure—Stephen Wolfram Writings](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/), published 2022-02-21  
This one is reread which just came to my mind the other night. I think it's interesting to see how highly efficient and successful people organize their daily workflow.
