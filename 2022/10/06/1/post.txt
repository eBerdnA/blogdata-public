This is the first post of hopefully long term series. "WIRLW" stands for "What I've read last week" and will be a loose collection of things I've read in the last week (which you've might have already guessed). This won't be just another collection of links but I will also provide some notes for each link.

This article is little bit older but [Venkatesh Rao](https://twitter.com/vgr) philosophizes about what it would mean to the blogging ecosystem if Elon Musk is buying Twitter (as we now know won't happen).

Pretty interesting read, seeing many myths about Containers (not the transport ones) being debunked. Key takeways are:
    - Containers need not have a full Operating System inside them
    - it's possible to run a Container without an image but you propably shouldn't
    - you need containers to build images
    - Containers are not just a linux but instead a standardized execution environments
    - You can create a bootable linux from an image. Even though it's possible you shouldn't do it except for your own entertainment.
