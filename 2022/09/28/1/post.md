from around 03:48 in the video:
> [...] It's a cool case study because two reasons. 1. it highlights something I say often on the show which is when it comes to organizing work especially in teams start with the process first. What makes the most sense for us to organize our work and then 2. figure out what tools you need to implemented that. [...]

It's always about the process and the people, not about the tooling. The latter can be solved once the processes are defined.
