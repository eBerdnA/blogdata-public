If you are working as a consultant, software engineer, or software architect you're often given the task to find a solution for a problem. Most of the time it is a business case from a customer. The customer can be your own employer or a client who asked for your support.

From my point of view, one if not the most important aspect of this is to get your own ego out of the way for finding a solution. But there are also other topics that are also important in this context and go hand in hand with getting your ego out of the way.

## Have customer obsession

In the end, it is the customer who will pay your bills. So always keep your customer in mind when trying to find a solution. With this having in mind, it could generate a better long-term outcome while having less revenue in the first place, but you will have a long-term happy customer.

## Many roads lead to Rome

There is more than one acceptable solution to solve a problem. It is totally fine when the preferred one was not brought up by you. As already mentioned, get your ego out of the way. It is not always a question of being right or wrong.

## Agree to disagree

In the end, someone must decide which solution will be implemented. Sometimes it can happen that not all people involved are of the same opinion. In this case, someone must recognize when disagreement is needed to proceed. But also, in this case, you should be sensible to acknowledge when it is not your solution which is the best one for the specific problem.

## KISS

More often people try to come up with the fanciest solution for a problem. Even though the fancy one might solve the problem it also might be unnecessarily complex. Habitually keep in mind that a solution should be [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).

## Frugality

Frugality is something that often comes to people's minds when they think about buying a coffee at their favorite cafe. But from my point of view, it is also something when trying to create a solution. Most of the time it can be done more inexpensively. For this, you need to talk with your customer and see where you agree on a compromise.
You simply don't need to create the fanciest solution just to pamper your ego. It is the outcome for the customer which counts.
