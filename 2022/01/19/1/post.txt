> The ALM Accelerator for Power Platform includes a canvas app that sits on top of Azure DevOps Pipelines and Git source control. The app provides a simplified interface for makers to regularly export the components in their Power Platform Solutions to source control and create deployment requests to have their work reviewed before deploying to target environments.

Very interesting to see that a platform that also targets citizen developers now gets more and more ALM tooling. My guess that professional developers were not happy with the given possibilities before. But I think that this is a good thing.
