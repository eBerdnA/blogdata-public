Normally I only include material written in English in my weekly edition. Nevertheless I found an article so interesting/important to share that I decided to prefix articles in German in the future so that readers not interested can skip them easily.

- (GER) ["Wir haben alle kein Immunsystem mehr!" - schwesterfraudoktors Webseite!](https://www.schwesterfraudoktor.de/2022/12/11/wir-haben-alle-kein-immunsystem-mehr/)
  

- [Confessions of an infosec has-been - lcamtuf’s thing](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/confessions-of-an-infosec-has-been)  
    Two key take aways from this article for me right. But there is so much more good stuff in it, you definitely should read it.
    
    > My final advice to new folks is to not look up to others. Judge your progress by looking back at your own work.

    > If there’s one skill I can credit for success, it’s [learning how to write well](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/writing-at-work).

    Even though there are a lot of other spots on my blog where I've already mentioned the importance of good writing skills, it's a so important topic that I don't get tired emphasizing it again.

- [Writing at work - lcamtuf’s thing](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/writing-at-work)  
    Some author as the article before. Continuing on the topic of how important writing is.

- [why i only use plain black wallpapers | ティラミス](https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/your-desktop-is-not-a-destination/)  
    After reading this I immediately realised the key message
    
    > **Your devices are tools, not fashion accessories.**

    is something which has been on my mind for quite some time but never formulated in such a clear manner.
