For different reasons I struggled this week to use the desired amount of time for meaningful reading. That's why this week's WIRLW only contains two links.

- [Using Paper for Everyday Tasks - Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/blog/gtd-on-paper-2021-06-13)  
    In the end I guess notes on paper beat every other system of information/task keeping. Admittedly information exchange with other (digital) system isn't very convenient. On the other hand paper simply works. Any time, any place. So next time when somebody is looking for a tool for personal organization they should perhaps consider paper.

- [Why you should have your own website](https://stormgrass.com/why-you-should-have-a-website/)  
    Basically everybody should a personal website and be it just for having some kind of digital business card. The most common excuses are debunked by this text. So just go for it!
