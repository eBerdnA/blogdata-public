- [Staying warm: What does an unheated room do to your body? - BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63602501)  
    That's an interesting finding. I wasn't aware before that the temperature also affects how capable one's brain is.  
  > "Science tells us that 18 degrees is the tipping point... the body is now working to defend that core temperature," Prof Bailey shouts over the droning fans.  
    
    Especially that the body already starts doing that already below 18 degrees.

    Now that the blue bird seems to be going down or at least is turning into burning trash can, it seems to be more important than ever that people are aware of the fact that it might be a good idea to own your content. But a higher independence comes together with a high barrier of adaption. I guess we as folks working in the IT industry need to be more aware of the fact that things which are obvious for us and not even remotely understandable to people outside our "bubble".

- [How to communicate effectively as a developer](https://www.karlsutt.com/articles/communicating-effectively-as-a-developer/)  
    I guess most of the recommendation can also be applied to different professions.  
  > Taking writing seriously at work or in your organization and putting in the effort to delight the reader will, over time, compound into a massive body of quality writing that benefits everyone. It is a literal win-win-win  
    
    During my half-year self-reflection I also realized that I need to be more concise when asking questions, especially providing the right context. The things you write and send to others are always for them and not for you. Keep that in mind when writing the next piece of information.

- [The Microwave Economy - David Perell](https://perell.com/essay/the-microwave-economy/)  
    I found this one especially interesting for two reasons.  
    1. The historical background of the word 'solitude'. 
    2. Somehow the key message resonates very good with the book ["Four Thousand Weeks"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks) by Oliver Burkeman.  
    
        > “The effect of convenience isn’t just that a given activity starts to feel less valuable, but that we stop engaging in certain valuable activities altogether, in favour of more convenient ones.”  
        
        — Oliver Burkeman, Four Thousand Weeks  
    
    It's also one of the things I realized this year while reading the book. Not everything has to be just convenient. With convenience we often loose the ability to see the value in certain things. More or less the exact same reasoning David Perell uses in his essay.
