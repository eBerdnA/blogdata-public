# Creating a new post

First checkout a new branch. Then create a new stub using of the following four commands. Each will use the corresponding template file from the `.templates` directory.

```bash
./prep-for-pub.sh new de-direct
./prep-for-pub.sh new en-direct
./prep-for-pub.sh new de-article
./prep-for-pub.sh new en-article
```

After the post has been written it can be prepped for publication running the script `./prep-for-pub.sh` prep. Afterwards create a PR and merge the created post.
