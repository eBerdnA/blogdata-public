> Itâ€™s not just Disney. Just shopping at a store is now pricier without an app, a loyalty card, coupons, or a digital wallet that traces your consumption patterns and habits.

I found this article via this [Toot](https://chaos.social/@cyberlyra@mastodon.social/109786821606126684). Especially the quoted part (above) resonated with me as I see this as an emerging pattern in Germany throughout the last years. Almost every grovery store now has their own loyalty card which is the only way to get access to certain discounts. In the end it's all about luring customers in to give their data away with the promise of more convenience (or savings) for them.

Not everything has to be convenient nowadays. Or as Oliver Burkeman has phrased it in [Four Thousand Weeks](https://bookwyrm.social/book/751744/s/four-thousand-weeks):

> Resisting all this as individual, or as a family, takes fortitude, because the smoother life gets, the more perverse you'll seem if you insist on maintaining the rough edges by choosing the inconvenient way of doing things. Get rid of your smartphone, quit using Google, or choose snail mail over WhatsApp, and people are increasingly likely to question your sanity. Still, it can be done.
