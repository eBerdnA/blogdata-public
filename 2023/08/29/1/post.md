Today I learned about the term "being glue" by reading the linked post.

I really like the way how all the work sometimes happening in the hidden is coined as "being clue" and explaining it with good examples from the daily life of a software engineer.

Thanks for [Paul Cantrell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAAmYkBGUuJ7ODBFw3PPBH0VOHhX86hl54) boosting and [Ken Barton](https://lnkd.in/eJTMP3Af) originally sharing this on Mastodon which made me aware of it.

And of course thanks to [Tanya Reilly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA3cYpABGtBBrpKOntFYq_MoaAd22D7yt6A) for writing it in the first place. üôè
