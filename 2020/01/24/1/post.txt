Unfortunately [John Feminella](https://twitter.com/jxxf/) does not allow to view his threads in [Thread Reader](https://threadreaderapp.com/). Apart from this fact you should have definitely a look at this thread: ["As of today, we have about eighteen years to go until the Y2038 problem occurs...."](https://twitter.com/jxxf/status/1219009308438024200). In addition you should then have a look at this one: ["Thread by @Foone: re: the 2020 bug because of bad y2k fixes..."](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1213498945525014529.html)
