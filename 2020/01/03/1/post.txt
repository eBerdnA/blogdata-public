If your New Years resolution is to get started with Microsoft Azure [Donovan Brown](https://twitter.com/DonovanBrown) tweeted about this article: [HOW TO LEARN MICROSOFT AZURE IN 2020](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/12/how-to-learn-microsoft-azure-in-2020/). You will get an overview what and where you can learn on Azure. In addition you can have a look at this video: [Learn what you can do with an Azure free account](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/patrick-kelley-msft_learn-what-you-can-do-with-an-azure-free-activity-6614967705537691648-v-Gu/)

[Tobi Lutke](https://twitter.com/tobi) [pointed](https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1210298134087323648) at "[The Value of Grey Thinking](https://fs.blog/2016/06/value-grey-thinking/)". I must admit that several years ago I was also often trapped in black and white thinking. But especially in IT it is important to think "grey" to find solutions for problems. The article provides a good foundation why you should also try to be better at thinking grey.

Interesting approach provided by [Oren Eini](https://twitter.com/ayende). He describes how to minimize friction when setting up a new (software) project. "[Proper software architecture for a new project](https://ayende.com/blog/189475-C/proper-software-architecture-for-a-new-project)" basically describes from my point of view kind of a combination of [MVP](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_Viable_Product) and a Scrum like approach.

[Nadeeja Bomiriya](https://twitter.com/ndbomiriya) wrote a good guide how to handle Dynamics 365 Release Management. "[[Best Practices] Dynamics 365 Release Management
](https://community.dynamics.com/365/b/dynamics365apps/posts/best-practices-dynamics-365-release-management)" explains furthermore which stakeholders need to be informed during such a release.
