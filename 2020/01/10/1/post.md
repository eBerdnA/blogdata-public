This weekly will start with a some articles dealing with patterns in software development.

* [Design Patterns: Observer](https://dev.to/ryhenness/design-patterns-observer-1196)
* [Implementing the Outbox Pattern](https://dzone.com/articles/implementing-the-outbox-pattern)
* [Kubernetes: Producer Consumer pattern with scalable consumer using dapr, KEDA and Azure ServiceBus Queues](https://anmock.blog/2019/12/27/kubernetes-producer-consumer-pattern-with-scalable-consumer-using-dapr-keda-and-azure-servicebus-queues/)

From my point of view it is more important to understand patterns in general than how to use every specific piece of software/programming language in detail especially if you are trying to move into an architectural role. Often you have to find a solution for a specific problem. This is from my observation easier if you have a broad toolset of patterns available instead of a specific piece of software. <br/>
The last one from the former ones is my personal favorite because it facilitates so much cutting edge technology like [KEDA](https://github.com/kedacore/keda), [dapr](https://dapr.io/) and [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/).

"[Async / Await: From Zero to Hero](https://dev.to/zhiyuanamos/async-await-from-zero-to-hero-a22)" is a must read for people trying to get their head around `async/await` in C#. [Zhi Yuan](https://dev.to/zhiyuanamos/async-await-from-zero-to-hero-a22) has written a great article to understand the concepts behind `async/await`.
