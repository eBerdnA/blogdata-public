[Matthew Devaney](https://twitter.com/mattbdevaney) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/mattbdevaney/status/1215278121416454146) some highlights from [Michał Guzowski](https://twitter.com/michaelguzowski).

1. [10 tips I wish to know before I’ve started with PowerApps](https://michalguzowski.pl/10-tips-i-wish-to-know-before-i-start-with-powerapps/)
2. [How to overcome 500 items limit in PowerApps](https://michalguzowski.pl/how-to-overcome-500-items-limit-in-powerapps/)
3. [PowerApps components patterns](https://michalguzowski.pl/powerapps-components-handbook/)

But in general you should keep an eye on the [blog](https://michalguzowski.pl/blog/) of Michał if you are interested in Power Platform/Apps topics.

Microsoft lately publishes more and more documents which in the past you would only have access to if you attended a training. [Manuela](https://twitter.com/ManuelaPichler_) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ManuelaPichler_/status/1214625921166172160) about the materials for the ['Admin in a day'](https://github.com/microsoft/powerapps-tools/tree/master/Administration/AdminInADay) training which are available on Github.

Last thing for this week is a [tweet](https://twitter.com/KeithWhatling/status/1220636676621504512) by [Keith Whatling](https://twitter.com/KeithWhatling) which shows a nice way to use the [`WITH`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-with) function in Power Apps.
