TIL that `timestamp` of Microsoft SQL Server is not a date or time data type but only a deprecated synonym for `rowversion`.

> The Transact-SQL rowversion data type is not a date or time data type. timestamp is a deprecated synonym for rowversion.

But `rowversion` doesn't preserve date or time either.

> Is a data type that exposes automatically generated, unique binary numbers within a database. rowversion is generally used as a mechanism for version-stamping table rows. The storage size is 8 bytes. The rowversion data type is just an incrementing number and does not preserve a date or a time.
