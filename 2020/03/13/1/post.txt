Looking for great input on .NET architecture? Then have a look at this [tweet](https://twitter.com/nishanil/status/1237757616337457164) by [Nish Anil](https://twitter.com/nishanil). Microsoft made four new e-books available. These are in detail:

* [Architecting Cloud-Native .NET Apps for Azure](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/azure/architecture#ebook-cloud-native-azure-swimlane)
* [Blazor for ASP.NET Web Forms Developers](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/architecture#ebook-blazor-for-web-forms-devs-swimlane)
* [gRPC for WCF developers e-book](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/architecture#ebook-grpc-for-wcf-devs-swimlane)
* [Modernizing Desktop Apps on Windows 10 with .NET Core 3.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/desktop/architecture#ebook-modernizing-existing-desktop-apps-swimlane)

If you are using Git you've probably heard of Git Flow. George Stocker has an interesting point in »[Please stop recommending Git Flow!](https://georgestocker.com/2020/03/04/please-stop-recommending-git-flow/)«.
