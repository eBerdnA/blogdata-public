This year's Microsoft Ignite was only a virtual event due to the well known circumstances we are all facing right now. From what I've read so far it was a great event. I didn't watch any session yet because I'm on holiday right now.

To get a summary of all news announced at Ignite 2020 one can always look at the so called book of news provided by Microsoft.
