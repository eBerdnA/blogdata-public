After I switched to Hugo as the generator for this page before some time ago, I often asked myself if a comment function could lead to a higher degree of interaction. Of course, this question is difficult or even impossible to answer afterwards. Anyway, the page is now run by WordPress again.

All URL patterns used so far should still work. If not, please leave a comment.
