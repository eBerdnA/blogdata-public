There is no command available for creating a file and the parent directories in one step. Nevertheless you can help yourself with a simple bash script. Just add the following snippet to your `~/.bashrc`.


    mktouch() { mkdir -p $(dirname $1) && touch $1; }

Afterwards you can run this command like this: `mktouch /home/demo/newdirectory/newfile1.txt`
