When you try to focus on one technology, such as Microsoft Azure, as I do, you often forget to think outside the box. Due to the current situation, Google has made all online training materials for the Google Cloud currently available for 30 days free of charge.

Really a good possibility to extend your own knowledge and to look beyond your own nose, if you have not had any contact with GCP before.

If you have had contact with databases as a developer, ask why things are the way they are and what needs to be considered to prevent problems. »[Things I Wished More Developers Knew About Databases](https://medium.com/@rakyll/things-i-wished-more-developers-knew-about-databases-2d0178464f78)« is a longer article, but a really good one.

There are several ways to get started using Microsoft Graph. One possible good one is »[A Lap around Microsoft Graph Toolkit in Day 1 - An Overview of Microsoft Graph Toolkit](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/blogs/a-lap-around-microsoft-graph-toolkit-in-day-1-an-overview-of-microsoft-graph-toolkit/)«.

Developers who are starting to get involved with Power Apps are often surprised that OOTB there are no popup dialogs in Power Apps. But not everyone needs to reinvent the wheel. Therefore you should use components that have already been developed by others. »[Canvas Power App Modal Dialog (Popup) - Power Platform Community](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Canvas-Apps-Components-Samples/Canvas-Power-App-Modal-Dialog-Popup/td-p/525015)« shows one possible way.
