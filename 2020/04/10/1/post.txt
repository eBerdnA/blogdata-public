Personally the biggest announcement this week was that Microsoft [announced](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21211721/microsoft-events-build-2021-digital-only-coronavirus-plans) that all of their events will be digital-only until July 2021. For me personally this could be an indicator on when we could expect things to become normal again after the current pandemic.

Are you interested in IoT and looking to get a »[AZ-220: Azure #MSIoT Developer certification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-220)«? Then you can get start your preparation with 
»[Set up an IoT Edge Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/set-up-iot-edge-gateway/)«.

If you ever wondered on how to create a solution using CQRS and Event Sourcing using C# then you definitely should have a look at »[A Fast and Lightweight Solution for CQRS and Event Sourcing](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5264244/A-Fast-and-Lightweight-Solution-for-CQRS-and-Event)«. A very comprehensive article which explains this end-to-end.
