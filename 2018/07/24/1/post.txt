 <p>Having my new drone for some days now I was facing a corrupt video file today. I guess it got corrupted when I turned off the drone before ending the recording. According to some information from the DJI forum this seems to be a known issue for some (maybe all) DJI drones.</p>
<p>Even though the <code>.mp4</code> file seems to be created properly on the SD card, beside the video file itself you can find a <code>.trinf</code> and a <code>.avc1</code> file.</p>
<p>Inside the DJI forum I found out that I&rsquo;m not the first person who had this problem. But luckily I also found a solution for this issue inside the forum. You can use the tool <strong>djifix</strong> which can be found <a href="http://djifix.live555.com/" target="_blank">&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;</a>. Inside the forum it is mentioned that the homepage seems to be offline sometimes.</p>
<p>Using the tool is pretty easy. Simply put the tool and the corrupt file inside a directory and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>djifix name-of-video-file-to-repair-including-any-.MP4-or-.MOV-filename-suffix
</code></pre>
<p>Afterwards you will have a <code>.h264</code> file. If needed this file can then be converted to <code>.mp4</code> afterwards using <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html" target="_blank">&lt;strong&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/strong&gt;</a>.</p>
